## Description 

This is a simple and clean note-taking application.  You run it in your browser. You make and ‚Äúsave‚Äù notes and they are saved persistently.  That means if you close your browser and turn your computer off the notes you made will still be there the next time you open the note taker. Your notes will stay there till you choose to delete them.

This application uses an Express.js back end. And it saves, retrieves, and deletes notes from a JSON file.

## How To Install This App
1. Clone the repository from my Github account
2. Go to the folder that has the cloned files and using your terminal run "npm install" that will install the dependencies you need, (Express, and UUID).
3. Then you can run "npm start" in that same console window and it will say "This bad boy is running! at http://localhost:3000 üöÄ" 
4. Then open your browser to localhost:3000 
5. Or you could simply use the App off of the Heroku site! But I figure you want to use the code. üòÅ
